Right now the reason you’re getting  
```
Error response from daemon: container … is not running
```  
is simply because `mcp-server` has already exited after hitting that `RuntimeError` in `run_http_enhanced()`. Once the process dies, `docker exec` can’t attach to it.

To run that import‑check script we need the container to stay alive long enough to get a shell inside it. There are a couple of safe ways to do that:

---

### 1️⃣ Start it without the crash‑path
Temporarily disable HTTP transport so the app doesn’t hit `run_http_enhanced()`:

```bash
# In your .env
MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=stdio
```

Then rebuild and start:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

With `stdio` transport, the server should stay up, and you can `docker exec` into it to run the Python snippet.

---

### 2️⃣ Run the image interactively without Compose’s restart policy
This bypasses the entrypoint crash loop and just drops you into a shell:

```bash
docker run --rm -it mcp-server:latest bash
```

From there:

```bash
source /opt/venv/bin/activate
python - <<'PY'
import sys
print("exe:", sys.executable)
import fastapi, uvicorn
print("fastapi OK:", fastapi.__version__)
print("uvicorn OK:", uvicorn.__version__)
for m in ("starlette", "orjson", "uvloop", "httptools", "python_multipart", "jinja2"):
    try:
        __import__(m)
        print("OK:", m)
    except Exception as e:
        print("MISSING:", m, "->", e)
PY
```

This will tell us exactly which extra module(s) are missing.

---

### 3️⃣ One‑shot container run
If you don’t want to drop into a shell, you can run the snippet directly in a one‑off container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it mcp-server:latest \
bash -lc 'source /opt/venv/bin/activate && python - <<PY
import sys
print("exe:", sys.executable)
import fastapi, uvicorn
print("fastapi OK:", fastapi.__version__)
print("uvicorn OK:", uvicorn.__version__)
for m in ("starlette", "orjson", "uvloop", "httptools", "python_multipart", "jinja2"):
    try:
        __import__(m)
        print("OK:", m)
    except Exception as e:
        print("MISSING:", m, "->", e)
PY'
```

---

Once we see the “MISSING:” lines, we can add those packages to the builder stage in your Dockerfile so they’re always present in the venv. That should stop the app’s HTTP transport check from failing and let the container run normally.

---
Jeremiah — in that sequence you actually ran the test **inside the container**, not on your host.  

Here’s why:

- You started with  
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it mcp-server:latest bash
  ```  
  That launches a new container from the `mcp-server:latest` image, drops you into its shell, and runs the image’s entrypoint logic before giving you a prompt.

- The `[INFO] MCP Server Docker Entrypoint` lines are coming from `/entrypoint.sh` **inside** that container.

- When you then did:  
  ```bash
  source /opt/venv/bin/activate
  python - <<'PY' ...
  ```  
  you were still in that container’s shell, using its `/opt/venv` virtual environment and its installed packages.

So the `exe: /opt/venv/bin/python` output and all the `OK:` lines are confirming the state of the Python environment **inside the container** — exactly the same environment the app uses when it runs normally.

---

That’s good news: it means all the expected HTTP stack modules (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `starlette`, `orjson`, `uvloop`, `httptools`, `python_multipart`, `jinja2`) are present in the runtime venv. The crash in `run_http_enhanced()` isn’t due to a missing import — it’s being triggered by something else in that method’s startup path.

The next step is to instrument `server.py` so we can see **what** in `run_http_enhanced()` is failing. That way we can stop chasing phantom “missing deps” and fix the actual cause.  

If you want, I can walk you through adding a quick debug wrapper around that method so the logs show the exact failing line before the RuntimeError is raised. That will pinpoint the real problem.
