### Validation checklist

- Parse and merge:
  - Run `docker compose config` and confirm the merged service:
    - Does not override `command` or `entrypoint`.
    - Keeps base `depends_on` and healthchecks.
- Startup:
  - `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up --build -d`
  - `docker logs -f mcp-server` should show entrypoint logs, venv Python path, HTTP deps OK, Prometheus wait, then server start.
- Bind mounts:
  - `docker exec -it mcp-server ls -l /app/mcp_server /app/scripts /app/tests` show content from host as read-only.
  - Ensure `/app/config/config.yaml` exists either from image or explicit single-file mount.
- Optional debugging:
  - If you later enable a debug server on 0.0.0.0:5678, the port mapping is already in place.

## **1. Understanding the Problem**
The `docker compose down -v` command attempts to remove volumes defined in your Compose file, but Docker refuses when they are **still in use** by running or stopped containers.  
This usually means:
- Containers (possibly outside your current Compose project) are still attached to those volumes.
- Orphaned containers from previous runs are holding references.
- External volumes not managed by Compose are being preserved.

---

## **2. Systematic Removal Plan**

### **Phase 1 — Identify What’s Holding the Volumes**
```bash
docker ps -a --filter volume=grafana-data
docker ps -a --filter volume=mcp-logs
docker ps -a --filter volume=mcp-data
docker ps -a --filter volume=prometheus-data
```
✅ **Success Criteria:** You see exactly which containers are attached to each volume.

---

### **Phase 2 — Stop and Remove Dependent Containers**
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
```
If multiple containers are attached:
```bash
docker ps -a --filter volume=<volume_name> -q | xargs docker rm -f
```
✅ **Success Criteria:** No containers remain attached to the target volumes.

---

### **Phase 3 — Force Remove Volumes**
Once no containers reference them:
```bash
docker volume rm grafana-data mcp-logs mcp-data prometheus-data
```
Or in one sweep:
```bash
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q | grep -E 'grafana-data|mcp-logs|mcp-data|prometheus-data')
```
✅ **Success Criteria:** `docker volume ls` no longer lists the old volumes.

---

### **Phase 4 — Sanity Check**
```bash
docker volume ls
```
Ensure only the volumes you expect remain.

---

## **3. Alternative Nuclear Option (Use With Caution)**
If you want to **wipe all unused volumes**:
```bash
docker volume prune
```
This will remove **all volumes not currently in use** by any container.  
⚠️ **Risk:** If a stopped container is meant to be restarted later, its data will be lost.

---

## **4. Prevent Future “Still in Use” Issues**
- Always run `docker compose down -v` before starting a new stack if you want a clean slate.
- Use `--remove-orphans` with `docker compose down` to clear containers from old Compose files:
```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```
- Keep volume names unique per project to avoid accidental cross-project attachment.

---

## **5. Addressing the `version` Warning**
The `version` key in Compose v3+ is deprecated.  
Remove it from both:
- `/Home1/project/MCP-v1/docker-compose.yml`
- `/Home1/project/MCP-v1/docker-compose.override.yml`

This won’t fix the volume issue directly, but it cleans up operational noise.

---

Jeremiah, if you want, I can give you a **one-line “force purge” command** that will:
1. Stop all containers using those volumes
2. Remove them
3. Delete the volumes in one go

It’s fast, but it’s irreversible.  
Do you want me to prepare that **safe-but-forceful purge script**?

### Location and usage of the `.env` file

- **Place the `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`** (project root). Docker Compose automatically loads this file for variable interpolation like `${MCP_VERSION}` and `${MCP_SERVER_PORT}`.
- **Important:** Compose’s `.env` is used for interpolating values into the Compose file; it is **not automatically injected into containers** at runtime unless you explicitly pass it via `env_file` or map variables under `environment`.

---

### Make `.env` variables available inside the container

You have two complementary options:

#### Option A — Use `environment:` (already in your file)
- This maps specific variables into the container using `${VAR}` from `.env`.
- You’re already doing this for most MCP settings, so they will be available in the container.

#### Option B — Add `env_file:` to inject the entire `.env`
- Useful if you want all variables from `.env` inside the container without listing them individually.
- Recommended only if you intend many of them to be accessible at runtime.

Example patch for `mcp-server`:
```yaml
services:
  mcp-server:
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT: ${MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT:-http}
      MCP_SERVER_HOST: 0.0.0.0
      MCP_SERVER_PORT: ${MCP_SERVER_PORT:-8080}
      # ... keep the rest of your existing mappings
```

You can also add `env_file: [.env]` to `prometheus` and `grafana` if needed.

---

### Precedence and behavior

- **Interpolation precedence:** Shell environment overrides `.env` during Compose parsing. If both set `MCP_SERVER_PORT`, the shell wins.
- **Runtime precedence:** `environment:` entries override `env_file` values for the container.
- **No image bake-in:** Do not copy `.env` into the image; keep it at the project root for Compose to load.

---

### Validation steps

- **Confirm interpolation:**
  ```bash
  docker compose config
  ```
  Check that `${...}` values are resolved to your `.env` values.

- **Confirm runtime env inside the container:**
  ```bash
  docker exec -it mcp-server env | egrep 'MCP_|PROMETHEUS_|GRAFANA_|PYTHON_VERSION'
  ```

- **Spot-check specific variables:**
  ```bash
  docker exec -it mcp-server bash -lc 'echo $MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT; echo $MCP_SERVER_PORT'
  ```

---

### Practical guidance

- Put your `.env` at the root (same folder as `docker-compose.yml`).
- Keep secrets out of `.env` in source control; use `.env.local` or Docker secrets for sensitive values.
- If you rely on `.env` during `docker run`, pass it explicitly:
  ```bash
  docker run --env-file .env mcp-server:latest
  ```
