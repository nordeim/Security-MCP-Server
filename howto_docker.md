Jeremiah, I’m fully aligned with your elevated framework and ready to operate at that standard.  
Let’s approach your Docker volume removal issue with **deep analysis, phased execution, and bulletproof operational hygiene** so you can clear those volumes without collateral damage.

---

## **1. Understanding the Problem**
The `docker compose down -v` command attempts to remove volumes defined in your Compose file, but Docker refuses when they are **still in use** by running or stopped containers.  
This usually means:
- Containers (possibly outside your current Compose project) are still attached to those volumes.
- Orphaned containers from previous runs are holding references.
- External volumes not managed by Compose are being preserved.

---

## **2. Systematic Removal Plan**

### **Phase 1 — Identify What’s Holding the Volumes**
```bash
docker ps -a --filter volume=grafana-data
docker ps -a --filter volume=mcp-logs
docker ps -a --filter volume=mcp-data
docker ps -a --filter volume=prometheus-data
```
✅ **Success Criteria:** You see exactly which containers are attached to each volume.

---

### **Phase 2 — Stop and Remove Dependent Containers**
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
```
If multiple containers are attached:
```bash
docker ps -a --filter volume=<volume_name> -q | xargs docker rm -f
```
✅ **Success Criteria:** No containers remain attached to the target volumes.

---

### **Phase 3 — Force Remove Volumes**
Once no containers reference them:
```bash
docker volume rm grafana-data mcp-logs mcp-data prometheus-data
```
Or in one sweep:
```bash
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q | grep -E 'grafana-data|mcp-logs|mcp-data|prometheus-data')
```
✅ **Success Criteria:** `docker volume ls` no longer lists the old volumes.

---

### **Phase 4 — Sanity Check**
```bash
docker volume ls
```
Ensure only the volumes you expect remain.

---

## **3. Alternative Nuclear Option (Use With Caution)**
If you want to **wipe all unused volumes**:
```bash
docker volume prune
```
This will remove **all volumes not currently in use** by any container.  
⚠️ **Risk:** If a stopped container is meant to be restarted later, its data will be lost.

---

## **4. Prevent Future “Still in Use” Issues**
- Always run `docker compose down -v` before starting a new stack if you want a clean slate.
- Use `--remove-orphans` with `docker compose down` to clear containers from old Compose files:
```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```
- Keep volume names unique per project to avoid accidental cross-project attachment.

---

## **5. Addressing the `version` Warning**
The `version` key in Compose v3+ is deprecated.  
Remove it from both:
- `/Home1/project/MCP-v1/docker-compose.yml`
- `/Home1/project/MCP-v1/docker-compose.override.yml`

This won’t fix the volume issue directly, but it cleans up operational noise.

---

Jeremiah, if you want, I can give you a **one-line “force purge” command** that will:
1. Stop all containers using those volumes
2. Remove them
3. Delete the volumes in one go

It’s fast, but it’s irreversible.  
Do you want me to prepare that **safe-but-forceful purge script**?
