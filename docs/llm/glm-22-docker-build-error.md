I'll help you diagnose and resolve this Docker build error. Let me start by analyzing the issue and then search for the correct package names for Debian trixie.







Based on my analysis of the error and extensive research into Debian trixie package naming, I can diagnose and resolve the issue.

## Problem Diagnosis

The Docker build is failing because the packages `libssl1.1` and `libffi7` don't exist in Debian trixie (the base image used in `python:3.12-slim-trixie`). These package names were used in older Debian versions like bullseye, but have been updated in trixie.

## Root Cause

Debian trixie uses newer versions of these libraries:
- `libssl1.1` → has been replaced with `libssl3t64` (runtime) or `libssl-dev` (development)
- `libffi7` → has been replaced with `libffi8` (runtime) or `libffi-dev` (development)

## Solution

I recommend using the development packages (`-dev`) because:
1. They include both runtime libraries and development headers
2. This provides maximum compatibility for Python applications that might need to compile extensions
3. It follows Docker best practices for Python applications

Here's the corrected Dockerfile section:

```dockerfile
# In your Dockerfile, replace lines 85-86:
# OLD:
# libssl1.1 \
# libffi7 \

# NEW:
libssl-dev \
libffi-dev \
```

## Complete Fixed Dockerfile Section

Here's the complete corrected section from your Dockerfile (lines 78-91):

```dockerfile
# Install runtime dependencies and security tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    nmap \
    masscan \
    gobuster \
    curl \
    ca-certificates \
    libssl-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    tini \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    && rm -rf /tmp/* \
    && rm -rf /var/tmp/*
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **For production builds**, you might want to consider using a more stable base image like `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` instead of trixie, as trixie is still in testing.

2. **If you specifically need trixie**, you could also use the runtime packages instead:
   ```dockerfile
   libssl3t64 \
   libffi8 \
   ```

3. **To fix the Docker Compose warnings** about `resources.reservations.cpus`, you can either:
   - Remove the `reservations` section if not needed
   - Or use Docker Swarm mode for full deployment resource support

## Verification

After making these changes, your build command should work:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

The fix addresses the package naming issue while maintaining all the functionality your MCP server needs. The development packages ensure compatibility with both runtime usage and any potential Python package compilation that might occur during the build process.
