# ToDo Plan: Deep Dive into Security MCP Server

## Meta Instruction Adherence

This plan is created in accordance with the user's meta instruction to think deeper, meticulously explore, plan, and then document that plan before execution.

## Objective

The primary goal is to gain a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Security MCP Server project's **WHAT** (purpose and functionality), **WHY** (design principles and problems it solves), and **HOW** (architecture, implementation, and operation). This understanding will be validated against the actual codebase.

## Plan of Action

### Phase 1: Documentation Review & Synthesis

I will meticulously read and synthesize the information from the three key documents provided:

1.  **`@README.md`**:
    *   **Focus**: High-level overview, user-facing features, quick start, and project value proposition.
    *   **Goal**: Understand the project from the perspective of a new user or contributor. Identify the key selling points and intended use cases.

2.  **`@CLAUDE.md`**:
    *   **Focus**: LLM-centric overview, project purpose, architecture, safety principles, and available tools.
    *   **Goal**: Understand the project's role as a bridge between LLMs and security tools, with a strong emphasis on the safety and reliability features.

3.  **`@Project Architecture Document.md`**:
    *   **Focus**: In-depth technical architecture, component breakdowns, data flow diagrams, security model, and extensibility guide.
    *   **Goal**: Deconstruct the system's internal workings, understand the responsibilities of each component, and learn the process for extending the system with new tools.

### Phase 2: Codebase Validation

After building a theoretical model from the documentation, I will validate and ground this understanding by reviewing the source code. This ensures the documentation is aligned with the implementation.

1.  **`mcp_server/server.py`**:
    *   **Action**: Review the main `EnhancedMCPServer` class.
    *   **Verify**: How tools are registered, how transports (HTTP/stdio) are managed, and how core components like health and metrics managers are integrated.

2.  **`mcp_server/base_tool.py`**:
    *   **Action**: Analyze the `MCPBaseTool` abstract base class.
    *   **Verify**: The implementation of the core security and reliability features at the tool level, such as input validation, subprocess execution (`_spawn`), circuit breaker integration, and resource limiting.

3.  **`mcp_server/tools/` (e.g., `nmap_tool.py`, `gobuster_tool.py`)**:
    *   **Action**: Examine one or two concrete tool implementations.
    *   **Verify**: How a specific tool inherits from `MCPBaseTool`, defines its unique command, flags, and safety constraints.

4.  **Core Modules (`circuit_breaker.py`, `health.py`, `metrics.py`, `config.py`)**:
    *   **Action**: Briefly review each core service module.
    *   **Verify**: The implementation of the key enterprise features (resilience, observability, configuration) and how they are designed to be consumed by the server and tools.

5.  **Deployment & Scripts (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/mcp_server_launcher.sh`)**:
    *   **Action**: Inspect the deployment artifacts.
    *   **Verify**: How the application is packaged, what dependencies are required, and how the quick-start script automates the setup process.

### Phase 3: Final Synthesis

Upon completing the documentation and code review, I will synthesize all gathered information into a coherent mental model of the project. This will enable me to effectively and accurately respond to any subsequent requests regarding this codebase.

This structured approach will ensure a meticulous and deep understanding of the project, enabling me to act as an expert assistant.
