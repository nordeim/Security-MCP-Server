Acknowledged — I'm ready to operate at the elevated standard you described. I will not reveal private chain-of-thought, but I will give a careful, actionable review, explain the problems and trade-offs, and propose concrete fixes with ready-to-use file updates.

Summary of what I did
- Reviewed README.md, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, entrypoint.sh, and .env.template.
- Found correctness, logic, and consistency issues that will break builds or runtime behavior.
- Prepared corrected versions of Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and entrypoint.sh (and a small note for .env.template) with explanations for each change.

Key problems found (high level)
- Dockerfile: gobuster installation path / GOBIN not set, so later COPY from /usr/local/bin/gobuster will likely fail. Final stage not named but docker-compose expects build target "runtime". The HEALTHCHECK command uses Python/requests in a way that will likely fail or is malformed in the Dockerfile CMD form.
- docker-compose.yml: build.target set to "runtime" but Dockerfile did not name the runtime stage. Healthcheck for the main service used Python/requests (again fragile). Prometheus host port mapping was inconsistent with README (9091 vs 9090).
- entrypoint.sh: basic but can be more robust when waiting for dependencies (use curl and timeouts) and better handle missing tools.
- Minor redundancies: repeated pip installs in builder and runtime stages — not strictly harmful but can be optimized.

Detailed issues and recommended fixes
1) Gobuster installation path (Dockerfile)
- Problem: go install will place binaries in $GOBIN or $GOPATH/bin. The builder set GOPATH but did not set GOBIN, and PATH does not include /go/bin. The Dockerfile later tries to COPY /usr/local/bin/gobuster from the builder stage which is unlikely to exist.
- Fix: Set GOBIN=/usr/local/bin (or move the binary) before running go install so gobuster is installed to /usr/local/bin/gobuster and can be copied reliably.

2) Docker build target mismatch (docker-compose.yml vs Dockerfile)
- Problem: docker-compose.yml uses target: runtime, but Dockerfile didn't name the second stage "runtime". Build will fail.
- Fix: Name the final stage in the Dockerfile as "runtime" (FROM ... as runtime) so compose's target matches.

3) Healthcheck syntax & dependencies on Python requests
- Problem: HEALTHCHECK in Dockerfile used: CMD python -c "import requests; requests.get('http://localhost:8080/health')" || exit 1 — this is invalid because the || is outside the CMD. Also relying on "requests" may fail if not present.
- Fix: Use curl -f for healthchecks (curl is installed in runtime stage). Use shell form or exec form that returns proper exit codes.

4) docker-compose service healthcheck
- Problem: It used Python/requests in test which is brittle. Use curl to test HTTP endpoint instead (curl is present in the runtime container).
- Fix: Replace with curl test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]

5) Prometheus host port mapping consistency
- Problem: README and .env.template indicate default Prometheus port 9090. docker-compose exposed Prometheus on host port 9091:9090 which is inconsistent.
- Recommendation: Expose Prometheus on 9090:9090 to match documentation, unless you intentionally want 9091 on host.

6) Redundant pip installs
- Observed two pip install runs (builder and runtime). This is often OK (builder for wheels, runtime for final environment), but be aware it increases build time. We left this intact but retained no-cache flags.

7) entrypoint.sh improvements
- Use curl in wait loop with a short timeout and a max attempt count to avoid infinite wait.
- Ensure PYTHONPATH append semantics (don’t clobber if present).
- Check for curl availability before using it.

Proposed corrected files
Below are corrected versions of Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and entrypoint.sh with the fixes applied. I left .env.template mostly the same (it's already fine), but I added a short note in the comment reminding users docker-compose reads .env in the project root (so copy .env.template → .env).

Notes for .env.template
- The .env.template looks fine. Just a reminder in the README or top of .env.template to instruct users to create a .env file (docker-compose reads .env) — e.g. `cp .env.template .env` — which your README already instructs. If you intentionally want Prometheus host exposed at 9091 on the host, revert the docker-compose change I made.

What I changed and why (concise)
- Dockerfile: set GOBIN to /usr/local/bin, named final stage "runtime", fixed HEALTHCHECK to use curl (robust), and copied gobuster from the right path.
- docker-compose.yml: set build target to runtime (matches Dockerfile), switched Prometheus host port to 9090 to match README, replaced fragile Python-based healthcheck with curl-based one.
- entrypoint.sh: made dependency wait more robust, verified curl availability, safe PYTHONPATH handling, and improved Python import validation.

Next steps and recommendations
- Run a local build: docker-compose build --no-cache security-mcp-server to verify the builder stage produces the expected binaries.
- If builder installation of hydra or masscan places binaries in non-/usr/local/bin locations on some distributions, add checks or use explicit install prefixes to ensure binaries end up in /usr/local/bin (or adjust COPY sources).
- Consider reducing image size by:
  - Using multi-stage to only copy required tool binaries and dependencies.
  - Removing large -dev packages from final image (they are already in builder; runtime still installs many -dev packages — evaluate if they're necessary).
- Add automated CI check to validate:
  - Dockerfile build completes (ci runs docker build --target runtime).
  - Container healthchecks succeed via docker-compose up in a test environment.
- Ensure requirements.txt includes 'requests' only if you actually rely on it at runtime. Current healthchecks use curl, so requests is not necessary for health checks.

If you want, I can:
- Open a PR with these file updates (I can prepare the exact patch and create the PR).
- Run a static verification checklist and produce a small checklist you can run locally (commands to run).
- Further optimize Dockerfile to reduce final image size (remove unnecessary runtime -dev packages, use slimmer base for runtime stage).

Which next step would you like? Would you like me to open a PR with these changes, or produce a compact checklist to run locally right now?
